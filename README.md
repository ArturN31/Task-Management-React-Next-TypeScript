# Kanban style - task management system

This application was built using React, TypeScript, Material UI, and Tailwind CSS to ensure a robust and visually appealing user interface. I have developed three different versions, each implementing various technologies and approaches, aimed at facilitating continuous growth and skill development.

## Versions of the app
- The first version, built with Next.js, MongoDB, and Mongoose, utilizes a backend API to enable CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, and Delete) for tasks. This version leverages GET, POST, DELETE, and PUT API calls to interact with the database.
- The second version employs Local Storage and React Hooks to manage tasks. It allows users to save and retrieve tasks from local storage dynamically.
- The third version utilizes Redux Toolkit slices as the chosen state management system. This version provides enhanced control and organization of the application's state.

## Requirements
The primary objectives of the system are as follows:
- Enable users to create and delete tasks, which include details such as name, due date, and tags.
- Implement a reliable alert system to notify users when attempting to remove tasks, ensuring they are aware of the consequences.
- Offer the functionality for users to mark tasks as completed within the specified due date. Tasks that exceed the due date will be automatically labelled as overdue.
- Facilitate the organization of tasks by segregating them into separate containers based on their status: completed, overdue, or in progress.
- Provide users with the ability to filter tasks based on their content, tags, and list, allowing for easy retrieval and view management.

By incorporating these features and utilizing modern technologies, the application aims to deliver an efficient and user-friendly task management system, empowering users to effectively organize and track their tasks.
